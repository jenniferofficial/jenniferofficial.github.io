How do we know when public space supports health, and when processes that shape public spaces are inclusive? Despite the growing evidence connecting place and health, design and physical activity, the natural environment and mental well-being, and more, there are few available resources to help planners and policymakers identify the kind of real evidence that is needed to help make decisions and fund public space projects that promote individual and community health and well-being. Similarly, though inclusion as a concept is well-discussed, there is no clear, shared working definition that can be tested and measured in urban planning and design, and in public health practice.

To bridge these gaps, Gehl Institute, with generous support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, developed the Inclusive Healthy Places Framework as a tool for evaluating and creating public places that support health equity.

### Program Purpose

The Inclusive Healthy Places Framework offers a new way of looking at the connection between health and public space. It leverages that connection to create places that restore advantage to populations that have been overlooked or excluded.

Organizing core themes and measurable indicators for practitioners working to advance health equity in public realm projects, it is a shared resource for research, planning, design, programming, and evaluation

### Program Activities

- Published full report and re- search-backed Inclusive Healthy Places Framework in June 2018.
- Launch workshop in Newark, NJ introduced the Framework and its concepts in a place-based and interactive setting.
- Communications strategy.
- Coordinated activities of a pro- gram advisory group.
- Built the field through outreachand engagement, including public presentations and keynote talks on three continents, webinars, blog posts and articles.
- Original research to identify the role of inclusive practices in supporting health equity outcomes through public realm interventions.
- Mixed methods approach: expert interviews, synthesis of outcomes of field tests, a scan of global best practices, a review of peer-reviewed literature, and a review of existing frameworks for promoting health through the built environment.
- Study tour for practitioners in Copenhagen, Denmark in June 2017 (led by program colleagues)
- Practicum event explored defi- nitions and draft observation tools in Philadelphia, PA in spring 2017 (led by program colleagues).

Building a tool to support inclusion and equity requires collaboration by nature. This was important in the the research process, and in shaping potential applications for the framework in future research and practice applications of the framework.
