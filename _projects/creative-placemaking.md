The New York City Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (DOHMH) and Gehl Institute partnered in 2018 to test new methods and indicators to evaluate the process and impact of community-led public art installations in parks, plazas, and streets in New York City neighborhoods. Health equity is at the core of the projects that were evaluated: Art in the Parks: Active Open Space and the 100 Gates Project.

Working with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Gehl Institute created a suite of tools based on its Inclusive Healthy Places Framework, with the dual purpose of building capacity among community organizations involved in a public art-making program, as well as within a city agency to collect a wider range of placebased and spatial data that can inform a shared understanding of the qualitative impacts and outcomes associated with creative placemaking work in the public realm.

### Program Purpose

Community-informed design interventions have been shown to promote health through enhancing walkability, increasing perceptions of neighborhood safety, and bolstering social cohesion. This evaluation partnership experimented with new ways of measuring these impacts in community contexts.

-----

### Interventions

Led by a unit within DOHMH with the mission of promoting active living by transforming the way people interact with public space, the goals of DOHMH’s Art in the Parks: Active Open Space and the 100 Gates Project artwork installation and programming were to provide enhanced access to active, attractive open space that improved neighborhood walkability and encouraged physical activity.

Gehl Institute conducted separate evaluations for the two programs:

_Art in the Parks_: Active Open Space provided small grants
and technical assistance to community based organizations
in 7-8 public spaces annually to solicit, build, and install twoor three-dimensional public artworks. The projects funded were selected through an application process that assessed the process for 1) selecting an artist, 2) engaging community, and 3) developing and implementing the artwork.

_The 100 Gates Project_ paired local artists and merchants to beautify storefronts through murals on security gates. Projects funded were identified through
a partnership agreement among merchants/landlords and a community coordinator for the 100 Gates Project. All projects were located in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan.

### Partners & Collaborators

- NYC Department of Mental Health and Hygiene
- Centers for Disease Control
- New York City community-based organizations
- 100 Gates Project

## TOOLKIT & METHODS

The project outcomes associated with both programs were to:

- Create a more inviting, inclusive, and active walking environment through art and engagement
- Encourage public space use and stimulate interaction with art
- Strengthen community

-----

> Does public artwork contribute to a more walkable environment?

-----

### Hypothesis & Framework

Does community engagement in public art-making enhance sense of place and belonging, and contribute to stronger social networks?

We expected to see a positive relationship between the presence of community-led and communityengaged public art installations and:

- Perception of the quality of the
public realm;
- Sense of place and representation through awareness of the artwork;
- Perception of sense of care demonstrated by civic organizations and neighbors; Demonstration of an enhanced sense of familiarity as a driver of walkability;
- Increase in pedestrian use of streets and parks near the artwork;
- Reported sense of belonging;
- Participation in programming related to the artwork; and
- Enhanced capacity for community organizations to implement similar projects.

### Toolkit Contents

The toolkit was built to shape both the interaction between DOHMH and their community partners, as well as to provide sufficient, rigorous qualitative data to respond to the research questions.

### COMMUNITY TOOLKIT

Purpose: To assist community art partners build internal capacity, develop a theory of change that connects process to desired project goals and impacts, and begin collecting data that helps tell the story of their work.

_This project created actionable research tools from the Inclusive Healthy Places Framework. The tools we created for use in on-the-ground research by DOHMH and in engagement and design activities by community groups participating in the project included a combination of original and adapted open-source formats and survey questions. Below, the Place Inventory-Inclusive Healthy Places uses indicators from the Framework about physical space design and quality to guide a structured observational analysis of a public space site to help decide where public art would be effective._

## EXAMPLE DATA

100 Gates Project
recruited, trained, and supervised a team of graduate interns to support fieldwork. This data was collected in September 2018 on 116th Street in East Harlem, in Manhattan.

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

Perception of feeling welcome increased with the number of visible works of art in the immediate area (100 Gates Project).

92% of Art in the Park survey respondents liked the artwork and felt it made the neighborhood a nicer place.

After artwork was installed, people were slightly more likely to feel that “People in this space are friendly and look out for each other,” and “I recognize other people who use this space when I am here.” (Art in the Park)
