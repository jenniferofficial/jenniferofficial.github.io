headline: I’m an urban planner, design researcher, and strategist with over a decade of experience in sustainable urban development at the community, city, and policy scales.

Currently, I support research and knowledge sharing as a consultant developing partnerships, tools, projects, experiences, and qualitative research focusing on the social and human factors that influence the built environment. In my accomplished career as a planner and program manager, I’ve worked across disciplines and sectors to deliver creative and impactful projects that help communities thrive.

I’m experienced in strategic project, program, policy, and organizational planning, having led multi-stakeholder initiatives from concept to implementation in New York City government and most recently at the global non-profit, Gehl Institute. My work has brought my expertise and enthusiasm to organizations, partners, and clients including the New York City Parks Department and Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Sidewalk Labs, Openbox Design, Gehl, WXY Architecture + Urban Design, PlayCore, Derivé LAB, and many other public offices, agencies, and non-profits working in and around the public realm. My projects and writing have been featured in the New York Times, Fast Company, The Architect's Newspaper, Planetizen, National Parks and Recreation Magazine, Curbed, Behavioral Scientist, Biophilic Cities Journal, BMC Public Health, and more.

I hold a Master's in City and Regional Planning from Pratt Institute, and a Bachelor's in English and Visual Studies from Cornell University.

**The role of the urban planner is as a collaborative partner.** Planners support clients and stakeholders not only to define and refine a vision, but to contextualize their projects and ambitions in the social and functional aspects of city-building. This includes translating research and knowledge from practice into action, uncovering and mobilizing diverse stakeholder audiences around galvanizing ideas and shared values. And this includes mediating challenging decisions about impact—on people, environment, and economy.

**Sustainable planning and development must be inclusive and build capacity.** As an urbanist driven by social impact and committed to urban innovation, I take an entrepreneurial and asset-based approach to building interdisciplinary coalitions and partnerships to identify necessary capacity, bridge disciplines, leverage available resources, and catalyze change.

**Clear and open communication of complex, multi-stakeholder projects starts with accessible and participatory frameworks and open-source tools.** I’m always looking for ways to translate and make more accessible the languages of technical planning and land use, urban economics, environmental impact, urban design, public health, research, and technology.

**My expertise focuses on the intersection of community development, wellbeing, resilience, and public realm policy and design.** Past work has included:

- Implementing citywide parks and public space capital programs in New York City;
- Building evidence and capacity around inclusion and health in place-based work, civic tech and open data about public life in cities, and research-based strategies for evaluating social impact of built environment decisions and the human dimension of the public realm;
- Leading waterfront resilience planning projects from the government side;
- Leading technical land use review for large-scale urban development;
- Revamping public agency stakeholder engagement strategies;
- Developing and delivering original course and workshop content for undergraduate and graduate student as well as professional audiences;
- Creating and authoring a range of technical reports, white papers, design guidelines, and policy frameworks connecting research to action;
- Building valuable business, research, and in-kind partnerships across sectors.
